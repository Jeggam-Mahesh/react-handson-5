    <h1>REACT HANDSON 5</h1>
    <h2>Q What is Pure Component?</h4>
    <p>Pure Components in React are the components which do not re-renders when the value of state and props has been
        updated with the same values.
        </p>
        <p>If the value of the previous state or props and the new state or props is the same, the component is not re-rendered.</p>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <P><ul type="1"
            >
            <li>These are useful when to avoid re-rendering cycles of your component when its props and state are not changed .</li>
            <li>Takes care of “shouldComponentUpdate” implicitly</li>
            <li>Pure Components are more performant in certain cases</li>
        </ul></P>
        <h3 >->How to use pure components:</h3>
        <h4>CASE: pure Component in case of state change</h4>
            <p>If the state of any variable is not changing then render() Will not be called, if the state is changing then render() will be called
            </p>
        <h4>CASE: when the state of any variable is changing, but the passing value in props for child component is not
            changing</h4>
            <p>In these case child component will also render itself for every state change, to prevent it from rendering use pure
                components in the child component as well</p>
            <h3>Pure Components Issues:</h3>
        <p>since here we are adding new elements to the array, but still render() is not called
            Reason: In case of the object the reference is being compared, we are getting inside the array and changing a particular
            value but the reference to that particular array is not getting changed, it still remains the same as a result of which this
            particular will give us true and for pure component, these are true as well and hence pure component feel that there is no
            change happen and it will not go ahead and will not render the components hence pure components are only to be used with
            simple variables that we have
            </p>
            <H2>example:</H2>
        <pre class="ans">
            import React from 'react'
            class App extends React.PureComponent;
            this.render(){
                const {points=0}=this.props;
                return (
                    <div>
                    
                    <span>{points}</span>
                    </div>
                )
            }
        </pre>
        <h2>Q.What is Higher order component(HOC) ?</h2>
        <p>
            Higher-order components or HOC is the advanced method of reusing the component functionality logic. It simply takes the original component and returns the enhanced component.
        </p>
        <p>We know that component transforms props into UI, and a higher-order component converts a component another component and allows to add additional data or functionality into this. Hocs are common in third-party libraries. The examples of HOCs are Redux's connect and Relay's createFragmentContainer</p>
        <h3>Syntax:</h3>
        <h4>const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent);</h4>
        <h3>Reasons to use HOC</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to handle</li>
            <li>Get rid of copying the same logic in every component</li>
            <li>Makes code more readable</li>
            <h4>example:</h4>
        <pre class="ans">
           
                    import React from "react";
                    import { useState } from "react";
                    const HocCntr=(wrappedComponent)=>{
                        
                    function Hoc(){
                        const [count,setcount]=useState(0);
                        const Incrment=()=>{
                            setcount(count+1);
                        }
                    
                    
                    return (
                        <>
                        <wrappedComponent Count={count} incrment={Incrment}/>
                        </>
                    )}
                    return  Hoc;
                    }
                    export default HocCntr;  
                </pre>
